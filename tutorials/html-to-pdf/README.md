<p class="main-content__segment-title">Getting Started</p>

## 1. Setting Up IronPDF for Java Projects

Integrating the [IronPDF](https://ironsoftware.com/) Library into a Java project can be achieved through two primary methods:

1. Incorporating IronPDF as a dependency in a project managed with Maven.
2. Manually downloading the IronPDF JAR file and adding it to your project's classpath.

Each installation approach will be succinctly described in the subsequent section.

### Option 1: Adding IronPDF via Maven Dependency

To incorporate IronPDF into your Java project with Maven, include the required artifacts in the `dependency` section of your project's `pom.xml` file.

Here is a rewritten version of the provided code block which is more clearly formatted and improved upon for readability:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ironsoftware</groupId>
    <artifactId>ironpdf</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST_VERSION_HERE</version> <!-- Replace LATEST_VERSION_HERE with the version you want to use -->
</dependency>
```

This code block should be inserted into your Maven project's `pom.xml` file under the dependencies section. Replace `LATEST_VERSION_HERE` with the specific version number that you intend to use.

The initial artifact points to the [most recent update of the IronPDF library](https://ironpdf.com/java/product-updates/changelog/). Additionally, the setup includes an [SL4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) implementation that facilitates the production of log messages by IronPDF's rendering engine while it operates. Developers have the flexibility to replace this logging dependency with other providers such as [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) and [Log4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/); they can also choose to skip it if logging is not a requirement for their project.

Execute the `mvn install` command in a terminal located in the root directory of your Java project to install the aforementioned dependencies.

### Option 2: Manually Installing the IronPDF JAR

For developers who choose to bypass Maven or any similar dependency management tools, obtaining and incorporating IronPDF involves a direct manual process. Begin by downloading the necessary IronPDF library JAR file, as well as the optional [SL4J library](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-simple) should you need it, and then proceed to include these files within your project's classpath.

You can directly download the IronPDF JAR from the [IronPDF JAR download link](https://ironpdf.com/static-assets/ironpdf-java/packages/ironpdf-2024.9.1-fat-jar.jar) or alternatively, source it from the Maven Repository.

## 2. Transforming HTML into PDF Formats

This segment highlights IronPDFâ€™s premier capabilities for rendering HTML into PDF files.

At the core of IronPDF's functionalities for creating and managing PDF documents is the `PdfDocument` class. This class offers a comprehensive suite of powerful methods specifically designed for various scenarios of HTML-to-PDF conversion: transforming HTML strings or markup into PDFs, converting HTML files directly into PDFs, and converting entire web pages (from URLs) into PDF documents. This section provides a concise overview of each scenario, supplemented with further resources for deeper exploration.

### 2.1 Incorporating the IronPDF Library

The entire suite of conversion and processing functionalities offered by IronPDF is encapsulated within the `com.ironsoftware.ironpdf` package.

To access these functionalities within your Java applications, make sure to add the following import statement at the beginning of your Java source files where you intend to utilize IronPDF:

```java
// Required import to access IronPDF's functionalities
import com.ironsoftware.ironpdf.*;
```

```java
// Include the IronPDF library for Java
import com.ironsoftware.ironpdf.*;
```

### 2.2. Configuring the License Key (optional)

While IronPDF for Java is available at no cost, PDFs created using the free version will include a watermark with a tiled background pattern, as illustrated below.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
		<a rel="nofollow" href="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-23.webp" target="_blank"><img src="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-23.webp" alt="" class="img-responsive add-shadow"></a>
    <p class="content__image-caption">Obtain a license key at ironpdf.com/java/licensing/ to convert and manipulate PDF documents without watermarks.</p>
	</div>
</div>

To produce watermark-free PDFs using IronPDF, you must integrate a legitimate license key into the library. Below is the code snippet that demonstrates how to set up your IronPDF with a license key.

Here's the paraphrased section with the relative URL path resolved:

```java
// Set the license for IronPDF usage
License.setLicenseKey("YOUR-LICENSE-KEY");
```

It's essential to apply your license key prior to creating or modifying PDF documents. For the best practice, initiate the `setLicenseKey` method at the very start of your code.

Acquire a license by [purchasing directly from the IronPDF license page](https://ironpdf.com/java/licensing/), or [reach out to us for a free trial license](https://ironpdf.com/java/licensing/#trial-license).

### 2.3 Configure the Log File Directory (optional)

Out of the box, if an SLF4J provider is in place, IronPDF outputs its log entries into a text file named *IronPdfEngine.log* situated within the root directory of your Java application.

To alter the log file's name or change its directory, use the `Settings.setLogPath` method:

```java
// Configure the logging file path
Settings.setLogPath(Paths.get("IronPdfEngine.log"));
```

**Important Reminder**: The method `Settings.setLogPath` should be invoked prior to any operations involving PDF conversion or manipulation.

### 2.4 Generating a PDF from an HTML String

The method `PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf` transforms HTML string data into a PDF file.

Below is a code example that demonstrates creating a PDF document from a simple HTML headline.

```java
// Creating a PDF from HTML content
PdfDocument pdfDocument = PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello from IronPDF!</h1>");
pdfDocument.saveAs("html_to_pdf.pdf");
```

Here's the paraphrased section of the article with enhanced comments in the code snippet and resolved URL paths:

```java
// Instantiate a new PDF document by converting HTML content using IronPDF
PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello from IronPDF!</h1>");
// Save the newly created PDF document to a file
document.saveAs("GeneratedPDF_from_HTMLString.pdf");
```

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
		<a rel="nofollow" href="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-5.webp" target="_blank"><img src="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-5.webp" alt="" class="img-responsive add-shadow"></a>
    <p class="content__image-caption">Convert HTML markup into PDF File using the <code>PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf</code>. This method can generate PDF documents using all valid W3C-compliant HTML and CSS markup.</p>
	</div>
</div>

The `renderHtmlAsPdf` function interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the same precision as contemporary web browsers that adhere to modern standards. This capability enables developers to fabricate PDFs that precisely mirror the appearance of content in a web environment.

Moreover, the `renderHtmlAsPdf` method is adept at integrating resources such as images, stylesheets, and scripts from local directories or network drives. The forthcoming example demonstrates the creation of a PDF from HTML content that utilizes a CSS stylesheet and an image stored within an `assets` directory:

Here's the paraphrased section of the code with enhanced comments, improved code structure, and resolved relative URL paths:

```java
// Define HTML content for PDF generation with a stylesheet and IronPDF's logo linked from the website
String htmlContent = "<html>" +
                     "<head><title>Hello world!</title>" +
                     "<link rel='stylesheet' href='assets/style.css'></head>" +
                     "<body><h1>Welcome to IronPDF!</h1>" +
                     "<a href='https://ironpdf.com/java/'><img src='https://ironpdf.com/assets/logo.png' /></a></body></html>";

// Convert the HTML content to a PDF document
PdfDocument generatedPdf = PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf(htmlContent);

// Save the generated PDF document to a file
generatedPdf.saveAs("output_from_html.pdf");
```

This version includes fluid narrative comments and refined code structure to enhance comprehensibility.

The output of the executed code is displayed in the image below.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
		<a rel="nofollow" href="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-24.webp" target="_blank"><img src="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-24.webp" alt="" class="img-responsive add-shadow"></a>
    <p class="content__image-caption"><code>PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf</code> can render all kinds of rich media elements. If it displays in Chrome, then <code>renderHtmlAsPdf</code> will render it!</p>
	</div>
</div>

An optional second parameter in the `renderHtmlAsPdf` method lets developers designate a base directory or URL from which web assets can be accessed.

For further details on the `renderHtmlAsPdf` method, explore [this practical code example demonstrating the use of HTML to craft a PDF](https://ironpdf.com/java/examples/using-html-to-create-a-pdf/), or peruse the [API Reference for the PdfDocument class](https://ironpdf.com/java/object-reference/api/com/ironsoftware/ironpdf/PdfDocument.html#renderHtmlAsPdf(java.lang.String)) for more comprehensive information.

### 2.5. Generating PDFs from Web URLs

Using the `PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf` function from IronPDF, developers have the capability to transform web pages into PDF files.

For instance, consider the scenario where you need to convert a Wikipedia article into a PDF document. Here's how it can be done:

Here's the paraphrased section with resolved paths:

```java
// Create a PDF document from a web page
PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF");
// Save the document to a file
document.saveAs("webpage_to_pdf.pdf");
```

The resulting format of the PDF file is illustrated below.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<div class="center-image-wrapper">
		<a rel="nofollow" href="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-7.webp" target="_blank"><img src="/static-assets/ironpdf-java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-7.webp" alt="" class="img-responsive add-shadow"></a>
    <p class="content__image-caption">The IronPDF java library can convert HTML content contained in web pages hosted online. Use the <code>PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf</code> method to make it happen.</p>
	</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

Suppose the HTML file is saved in a directory named `invoices` along with its associated CSS and JavaScript files. You can convert this HTML file to a PDF using the IronPDF library with the following code:

```java
// Convert local HTML file to PDF
PdfDocument pdf = PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf("C:/invoices/TestInvoice1.html");
pdf.saveAs("htmlfile_to_pdf.pdf");
```

IronPDF ensures all relative URLs within the HTML document are correctly resolved, allowing the produced PDF to authentically represent the intended design influenced by any linked stylesheets and scripts.

Here is the paraphrased section of HTML:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Invoice</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <link rel="license" href="https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license/">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

    </address>
    <span><img alt="" src="http://www.jonathantneal.com/examples/invoice/logo.png"><input type="file" accept="image/*"></span>
</header>
<article>
    <h1>Recipient Details</h1>
    <address contenteditable>
        <p>Some Company<br>c/o Some Guy</p>
    </address>
    <table class="meta">
        <tr>
            <th><span contenteditable>Invoice Number</span></th>
            <td><span contenteditable>101138</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><span contenteditable>Invoice Date</span></th>
            <td><span contenteditable>January 1, 2012</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><span contenteditable>Total Amount Due</span></th>
            <td><span id="prefix" contenteditable>$</span><span>600.00</span></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <table class="inventory">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th><span contenteditable>Service</span></th>
            <th><span contenteditable>Description</span></th>
            <th><span contenteditable>Charge</span></th>
            <th><span contenteditable>Hours</span></th>
            <th><span contenteditable>Subtotal</span></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a class="cut">-</a><span contenteditable>Front End Consultation</span></td>
            <td><span contenteditable>Experience Review</span></td>
            <td><span data-prefix>$</span><span contenteditable>150.00</span></td>
            <td><span contenteditable>4</span></td>
            <td><span data-prefix>$</span><span>600.00</span></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <a class="add">+</a>
    <table class="balance">

            <td><span data-prefix>$</span><span contenteditable>0.00</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><span contenteditable>Outstanding Balance</span></th>
            <td><span data-prefix>$</span><span>600.00</span></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</article>
<aside>
    <h1><span contenteditable>Notes</span></h1>
    <div contenteditable>
        <p>A finance charge of 1.5% will be applied on outstanding amounts after 30 days.</p>
    </div>
</aside>
</body>
</html>
``` 

This paraphrased HTML section reflects a clearer and slightly varied structure while maintaining the original informational content and functionalities such as `contenteditable`. The source URL link to the MIT license and scripts remains unchanged to ensure functional integrity.

Assuming that your HTML file, along with its corresponding CSS and JavaScript files, are stored in a directory named "invoices," you can utilize IronPDF to transform this HTML into a PDF document in the following manner:

Here's the paraphrased section including the absolute URL paths:

```java
// Create a PDF from an HTML file located on your system
PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf("C:/invoices/TestInvoice1.html");
// Save the generated PDF to a file
document.saveAs("htmlfile_to_pdf.pdf");
```

Similar to the examples shown earlier for converting HTML strings to PDF, IronPDF adeptly handles the resolution of relative URLs within an HTML document to their appropriate paths on the local file system. Consequently, the final PDF produced through this process faithfully replicates the visual impact that any linked stylesheets and scripts would typically have when viewed on a web page.
