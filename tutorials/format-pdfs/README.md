# HTML to PDF Conversion in Java

*This guide is designed for Java developers who want to learn about using the IronPDF library to turn HTML content into flawless PDF documents.*

*IronPDF serves as a comprehensive solution for PDF conversion and manipulation, supporting both [.NET](https://ironpdf.com) and [Java](https://ironpdf.com/java/) environments. This guide focuses specifically on using IronPDF for HTML to PDF conversion in Java applications. For similar guidance on .NET, please refer to [this tutorial](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/).*

### Getting Started

## Step 1: Installing IronPDF for Java

### Step 1.1: Add IronPDF as a Maven Dependency

Incorporate IronPDF into your Java project as a Maven dependency by entering the following code into your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ironsoftware</groupId>
  <artifactId>ironpdf</artifactId>
  <version>2022.12.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

The first line adds the [latest IronPDF library version](https://ironpdf.com/java/product-updates/changelog/). The second is for an SL4J implementation, crucial for logging during rendering processes. Developers may switch this with other loggers such as [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) or [Log4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/); it's also removable if logging isn't necessary.

Run the `mvn install` command in your project's root directory to start the installation of the libraries above.

### Step 1.2: Manually Install the IronPDF JAR

For those not using Maven, manually download and install the [IronPDF JAR library](https://ironpdf.com/static-assets/ironpdf-java/packages/ironpdf-2022.12.0-fat-jar.jar) along with the necessary [SL4J package](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-simple).

### Step 1.3: Import the IronPDF package

Ensure that IronPDF's functions are accessible within your application by including the import declaration at the beginning of your Java source files.

```java
// Import statement for Java IronPDF
import com.ironsoftware.ironpdf.*;
```

### Step 1.4: Optionally Set the License Key

Although IronPDF is freely available, a license key is required to remove the watermark from the PDFs created. Implement the license key using the code below:

```java
// Insert your license key to avoid watermarks
License.setLicenseKey("YOUR-LICENSE-KEY");
```

Make sure the license key is configured before generating any PDF document, as recommended here:

![Apply a license key to avoid watermarks](https://ironpdf.com/static-assets/pdf/java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-23.webp "License Key Activation")

[Purchase a license](https://ironpdf.com/java/licensing/) or [request a trial key](#trial-license).

### Step 1.5: (Optional) Customize Log File Path

By default, IronPDF will log messages to `IronPdfEngine.log` in your project root. You can specify another path using the `Settings.setLogPath` method:

```java
// Configuring the log file path
Settings.setLogPath(Paths.get("CustomLogPath.log"));
```

*Note: Define your log path before invoking any PDF processing functions.*

### How-To Guide and Code Examples

## Section 2: Converting HTML to PDF

IronPDF excels at rendering HTML content into PDF format, supporting direct conversion from HTML strings, files, and URLs. Here's an overview of each method:

### Step 2.1: Generate a PDF from an HTML String

Using `PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf`, transform a simple HTML string into a PDF:

```java
PdfDocument pdf = PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello from IronPDF!</h1>");
pdf.saveAs("htmlstring_to_pdf.pdf");
```

![Example of HTML to PDF conversion](https://ironpdf.com/static-assets/pdf/java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-5.webp "HTML string to PDF Example")

The method processes all valid HTML/CSS content as seen in modern browsers, ensuring high-fidelity PDF outputs. External assets like CSS or images are recognized and incorporated effectively into the resultant PDFs.

```java
String html = "<html><head><title>Welcome!</title><style href='style.css'></style></head><body><h1>Hello from IronPDF!</h1><img src='logo.png'></body></html>";
PdfDocument pdf = PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf(html);
pdf.saveAs("detailed_output.pdf");
```

![Rich media rendering example](https://ironpdf.com/static-assets/pdf/java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-24.webp "Rich Media Rendering Example")

Additional control over asset paths can be specified through an optional base parameter.

More on `PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf` can be found [here](https://ironpdf.com/java/examples/using-html-to-create-a-pdf/).

### Step 2.2: Create a PDF from a URL

```java
PdfDocument pdf = PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF");
pdf.saveAs("url_to_pdf.pdf");
```

![Conversion from URL example](https://ironpdf.com/static-assets/pdf/java/tutorials/html-to-pdf/html-to-pdf-7.webp "URL to PDF Conversion Example")

Details on URL to PDF conversion can be found [here](https://ironpdf.com/java/examples/converting-a-url-to-a-pdf/).

### Step 2.3: Convert an HTML File to PDF

Convert stored HTML files directly like this:

```java
PdfDocument pdf = PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf("C:/invoices/TestInvoice1.html");
pdf.saveAs("htmlfile_to_pdf.pdf");
```

All relative URLs in the HTML are accurately resolved. This meticulous conversion preserves the visual integrity of web-based assets.
