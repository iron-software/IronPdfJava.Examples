# How to Generate PDF Files in Java

*Automating the creation of PDF documents via Java can be immensely beneficial, such as devising invoices, reports, or any other kind of PDFs on demand. This guide elaborates on using IronPDF to construct PDF documents within Java-based applications.*

## Overview of IronPDF Java PDF Library

IronPDF serves as a straightforward Java library capable of producing PDF documents directly from HTML. It includes features like:

1. Incorporating text, images, and various other content into PDFs
2. Selecting fonts and colors, and managing layout and document formatting

This library is based on the .NET Framework, enabling its integration into both .NET and Java environments, thus offering flexibility across different programming scenarios.

Moreover, IronPDF extends its capabilities beyond PDF creation to include tasks like file format conversions, extracting text and data from PDFs, and adding password protection to PDF documents.

## Steps for Creating PDF Documents in Java Applications

### Prerequisites

Before you commence using IronPDF in your Maven project, make sure the following software is installed on your machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Essential for compiling and executing Java applications. Available for download at [Oracle’s website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. **Maven:** Necessary for managing project dependencies. Download it from the [Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
3. **IronPDF Library:** Add IronPDF as a dependency in your Maven project’s `pom.xml` using the following snippet:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ironsoftware</groupId>
    <artifactId>ironpdf</artifactId>
    <version>%s</version>
</dependency>
```

### Preliminary Code Setup

Begin by importing IronPDF's library classes at the start of your Java source file.

```java
import com.ironsoftware.ironpdf.*;
```

Next, activate IronPDF with a valid license key by calling `setLicenseKey` in your `main` method.

```java
License.setLicenseKey("Your license key");
```

**Note**: *Acquire a license key to enable watermark-free PDF creation. [Buy a license](https://ironsoftware.com/java/licensing/) or [get a free trial](https://ironsoftware.com/java/licensing/#trial-license) license key.*

## Generating a PDF from HTML Content

To turn HTML content into a PDF, use the `renderHtmlAsPdf()` function.

```java
String htmlContent = "<h1>Greetings from IronPDF!</h1><p>This is a sample HTML snippet.</p>";
PdfDocument pdf = PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf(htmlContent);
```

Save the document locally:

```java
pdf.saveAs(Paths.get("sample.pdf"));
```

## Creating PDFs from HTML Files

To create a PDF from a local HTML file:

```java
PdfDocument pdfFromFile = PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf("sample.html");
pdfFromFile.saveAs(Paths.get("output.pdf"));
```

IronPDF will process the HTML and its styles just like a web browser does.

## Generating PDFs from URLs

The `renderUrlAsPdf` method enables generating a PDF from a webpage:

```java
PdfDocument webPdf = PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf("https://ironpdf.com");
webPdf.saveAs(Paths.get("webOutput.pdf"));
```

Learn more about this from the [URL to PDF Guide](https://ironpdf.com/java/examples/converting-a-url-to-a-pdf/).

## Customizing PDF Formats

Use the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` class to define specifics like orientation and margin sizes. Enhance your PDF generation by visiting [PDF Generation Settings Guide](https://ironpdf.com/java/examples/pdf-generation-settings/).

## Securing PDF Documents

Secure PDFs with a password using the `SecurityOptions` class:

```java
SecurityOptions security = new SecurityOptions();
security.setUserPassword("YOUR_PASSWORD");
```

Apply this security to your document:

```java
SecurityManager manager = webPdf.getSecurity();
manager.setSecurityOptions(security);
webPdf.saveAs("secureOutput.pdf");
```

See the secured PDF prompt for a password upon opening.

## Full Source Code Example

Below is a complete Java application showcasing the described functionalities:

```java
// Imports for IronPDF
import com.ironsoftware.ironpdf.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Paths; 

public class PDFGenerator
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    {
        License.setLicenseKey("Your License Key");
        String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello World!</h1><p>This is a sample HTML snippet.</p>";
        PdfDocument pdf = PdfDocument.renderHtmlAsPdf(htmlContent);
        pdf.saveAs(Paths.get("html.pdf"));
        PdfDocument pdfFromFile = PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf("sample.html");
        pdfFromFile.saveAs(Paths.get("fileOutput.pdf"));
        PdfDocument webPdf = PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf("https://ironpdf.com");
        webPdf.saveAs(Paths.get("webOutput.pdf"));

        SecurityOptions security = new SecurityOptions();
        security.setUserPassword("YOUR_PASSWORD");
        SecurityManager manager = webPdf.getSecurity();
        manager.setSecurityOptions(security);       
        webPdf.saveAs(Paths.get("secureOutput.pdf"));
    }
}
```

IronPDF ensures that all graphics and interactive elements remain functional within the generated PDF.
