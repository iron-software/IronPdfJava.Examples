# Printing PDFs in Java with IronPDF

## Introduction

In Java development, handling PDF files is essential because it enables developers to generate, manipulate, and maintain documents in a standardized format that is both platform-independent and broadly supported. For Java applications that manage substantial document workflows or require document manipulation capabilities, the ability to interact seamlessly with PDFs is crucial.

This guide will walk through the process of utilizing the IronPDF library to produce and print PDF documents within Java applications.

## IronPDF: A Comprehensive Java PDF Library

IronPDF is an advanced library designed for Java that facilitates the generation, manipulation, and conversion of PDF files. Building on the functionality of the [IronPDF C# .NET library](https://ironpdf.com/), it delivers a similar experience optimized for Java developers.

With IronPDF, developers gain access to a robust API that simplifies the complexities of PDF manipulation, allowing for straightforward implementations of document creation, content addition, text formatting, and the seamless handling of document merges and splits.

Additionally, IronPDF excels in converting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into PDF documents. This feature is particularly useful for easily transferring web content or HTML-based designs into portable document formats. It also supports direct printing of PDF documents.

## Steps to Print a PDF with IronPDF in Java

### Prerequisites

Before starting with PDF printing in Java, ensure you have:

1. An IDE such as Eclipse or any other Java development environment
2. A Maven project set up in your chosen IDE
3. A reliable internet connection for library installation

### Installing IronPDF in a Maven Project

To incorporate IronPDF into a Maven project, insert the necessary IronPDF dependency into your **pom.xml**. Once edited, execute the `mvn install` command or use Ctrl+S to start the download and installation of IronPDF.

It's necessary to import IronPDF classes into your main `App.java` within the src folder.

	</div>
</div>

To proceed, include the following import statement in your "App.java":

```java
import com.ironsoftware.ironpdf.*;
```

## Loading a PDF in Java

IronPDF for Java allows the loading of PDF content from various sources, including file paths or byte arrays, and supports the inclusion of a password if the document is protected.

The following code snippet demonstrates loading a PDF from the filesystem:

```java
License.setLicenseKey("Your-License-Key");  
PdfDocument pdf = new PdfDocument(Paths.get("Path-To-Your-PDF.pdf"));
```

## Default PDF Printing

To print a PDF document using the default printer settings without any user input, utilize the `printWithoutDialog` method provided by IronPDF:

```java
pdf.printWithoutDialog();
```

## Utilizing the Print Dialog

For a more interactive approach, IronPDF supports customization of print settings through a user dialogue:

```java
pdf.print();
```

When this method is called, a print dialog appears, allowing the user to adjust settings like printer selection, paper size, and copy number.

        pdf.printWithoutDialog();
        pdf.print();
    }
}
```
