IronPDF gives you the capability to directly incorporate images into your PDF documents:

- Image Files
- `System.Drawing.Image`
- `System.Drawing.Bitmap`

This feature is particularly beneficial for eliminating the need to load external assets during the process of [HTML to PDF conversion](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/).
