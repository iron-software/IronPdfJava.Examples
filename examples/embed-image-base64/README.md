IronPDF supports embedding images directly into PDF documents:

- Image Files
- `System.Drawing.Image`
- `System.Drawing.Bitmap`

This feature is particularly beneficial as it eliminates the need to load external assets when performing [HTML to PDF conversion](https://ironpdf.com/tutoraisl/html-to-pdf/).
