The following code snippet highlights the robust capabilities of IronPDF in transforming HTML content into PDF documents.

The `ChromePdfRenderOptions` class provides developers with comprehensive control over the conversion of web pages to PDFs.

Using the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` class, developers can tailor several aspects of the PDF creation process. This includes setting page margins, choosing page orientations, inserting annotations, embedding bookmarks, editing document metadata, tweaking zoom scaling, altering CSS rules, and much more. These options can be configured within an instance of this class and then passed as an optional second parameter to any of the static PDF rendering methods (`renderHtmlAsPdf`, `renderHtmlFileAsPdf`, and `renderUrlAsPdf`). This configurability allows developers to influence how IronPDF interprets and renders web content into PDF format during the execution of these methods.
