IronPDF enables the conversion of HTML files from a local or networked file path into PDFs. This is achieved by utilizing the `PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf` method showcased in the example provided.

Upon successful execution, the `PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf` method returns a new `PdfDocument` object that encapsulates the contents from the specified HTML file. This method meticulously renders all associated assets referenced relatively in the HTML file—including stylesheets, scripts, and images—to ensure they appear correctly in their intended context within the PDF.

Essentially, the HTML file is presented in the PDF precisely as it would appear in a web browser, complete with all visual elements and styles intact.

Should there be an issue locating or accessing the HTML file, `PdfDocument.renderHtmlFileAsPdf` will issue an `IOException`.

For further details on customizing the PDF output, please consult the [API Documentation page for the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` class](https://ironpdf.com/java/object-reference/api/com/ironsoftware/ironpdf/render/ChromePdfRenderOptions.html), which provides additional information on enhancing the appearance of PDFs generated from the `renderHtmlFileAsPdf` method.
