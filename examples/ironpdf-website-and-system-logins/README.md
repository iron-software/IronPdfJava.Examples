To transform web pages that lie behind HTML forms and password-protected directories into PDF files efficiently, it is often recommended to bypass programmatic authentication and instead utilize either local files or HTML strings directly for rendering, as detailed on [the IronPDF login procedures resource page](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/logins/). Nonetheless, if obtaining the source code of web pages for manual conversion is too difficult, time-consuming, or simply not possible, IronPDF offers a straightforward solution to smoothly generate PDFs from these restricted areas.

For pages tucked away in password-protected directories, you first need to create a `ChromeHttpLoginCredentials` object with valid network credentials tailored for use with IronPDF's PDF Renderer. Subsequently, provide this credentials object and the URL of the secure webpage to the `PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf` method:

```java
// Create a PDF from a password-protected URL using specified login credentials
PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf(restrictedUrl, loginCredentials).saveAs(Paths.get("output.pdf"));
```
