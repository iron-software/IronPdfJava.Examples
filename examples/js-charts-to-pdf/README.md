IronPDF efficiently handles the conversion of web pages that incorporate complex visual elements like charts and graphs developed using modern JavaScript frameworks.

IronPDF is proficient in rendering web canvas elements by leveraging WebGL technology, which utilizes the machine's native graphic processing capabilities.

The library is compatible with all major third-party charting libraries, such as:

- C3.js
- D3.js
- Highcharts

By using the `setEnableJavaScript` method on the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` object, developers can activate JavaScript processing for web pages. This setting must be enabled to ensure that IronPDF can properly render JavaScript-driven content such as charts and graphics.

Furthermore, IronPDF offers the `setRenderDelay` method, which delays the processing of a web pageâ€™s JavaScript until after the DOM has fully loaded. This delay, specified in milliseconds, accommodates the execution of asynchronous JavaScript that might not complete immediately upon page load. This feature is crucial for capturing dynamically-loaded content in the final PDF.

For a deep dive into how these settings can be configured, check out the [rendering options code example](https://ironpdf.com/java/examples/js-charts-to-pdf/) which provides further insights into the capabilities of the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` class.
