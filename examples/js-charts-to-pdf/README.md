IronPDF is capable of rendering web pages that feature advanced JavaScript-created charts, graphs, and other interactive elements.

Utilizing WebGL technology, IronPDF can effectively handle elements created with web canvas, utilizing the hardware graphics capabilities of the system.

IronPDF is compatible with numerous third-party chart libraries, such as:

- C3.js
- D3.js
- Highcharts

Using the `setEnableJavaScript` method found on the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` object, developers have the option to activate the processing of both internally and externally referenced JavaScript within a web page. This setting must be enabled for IronPDF to successfully process the JavaScript essential for displaying charts and graphics on a webpage.

Moreover, the `setRenderDelay` allows IronPDF to delay the processing of a web pageâ€™s JavaScript slightly, for a predefined period in milliseconds, after the web page's DOM has been fully loaded. This delay is crucial for capturing web content that might only appear moments after a browser has initially loaded the page, particularly applicable for asynchronously executing JavaScript.
