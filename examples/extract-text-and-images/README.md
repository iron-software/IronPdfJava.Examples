IronPDF, a robust component of the Iron Software suite, offers a wide array of tools for both generating and manipulating PDFs. Among these, its content extraction functions stand out, permitting detailed processing of PDF document contents.

All `PdfDocument` instances feature the `extractAllText` method, which retrieves text from every page of a PDF, returning it as a single `String`. In a similar manner, `extractAllImages` gathers all the images from a PDF, each represented as a `BufferedImage` object; for those needing raw image data, `extractAllRawImages` serves this purpose.

These methods are especially useful for swift, whole-document content extraction from extensive PDF files that could contain significant amounts of text and images spread across many pages. Once extracted, the content can be handled as necessary, following the specific requirements of your applicationâ€”this might include analyzing text line-by-line via sophisticated algorithms or storing each image in separate files, as illustrated in the provided code example.

For more precise content extraction needs, avoiding unnecessary resource consumption, developers can turn to `extractTextFromPage` and `extractAllImagesFromPages`. Both accept a `PageSelection` enum, facilitating extraction from specific pages.

Below is a concise Java example demonstrating how to extract text from the first page and all images from specific pages of a PDF:

```java
PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.fromFile(Paths.get("sample.pdf"));  
String firstPageText = document.extractTextFromPage(PageSelection.firstPage());  
// Extracts images from a specific range of pages
List<BufferedImage> pageRangeImages = document.extractAllImagesFromPages(PageSelection.pageRange(3, 7));
```
