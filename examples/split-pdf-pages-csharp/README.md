IronPDF provides the capability to break down PDF documents by extracting specific pages or ranges of pages into new `IronPdf.PdfDocument` objects. For comprehensive guidance on how to separate or reproduce pages from PDF documents utilizing IronPDF, refer to the [IronPDF Split and Merge Guide](https://ironpdf.com/java/examples/split-pdf/) on the official IronPDF site.

The C# .NET method `IronPdf.PdfDocument.CopyPage` enables the duplication—or extraction—of pages from existing PDF files into a new document. For further information on how to implement the `CopyPage` functionality in your projects, please see the [IronPDF Copy Page Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.PdfDocument.html#IronPdf_PdfDocument_CopyPage_System_Int32_).
