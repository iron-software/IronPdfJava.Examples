IronPDF provides the capability to divide PDF documents by extracting individual pages or page ranges into new `IronPdf.PdfDocument` objects.

In C# .NET, the API `IronPdf.PdfDocument.CopyPage` is used for this purpose, often referred to as _Extracting Pages_ from one or more PDF files into a new document.
