IronPDF simplifies the process of converting HTML content into PDF format from various sources, including URLs. The following code sample demonstrates how to generate a PDF document from web pages located on both local and external servers using the `PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf` method in Java. This function produces a `PdfDocument` instance, which can be subsequently stored using the `saveAs` method.

The `PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf` method requires a fully-qualified URL as a string input. IronPDF then fetches the HTML content via an HTTP request from the specified URL and accurately converts it into a PDF document. For web pages that require authentication, developers can pass `ChromeHttpLoginCredentials` as an optional second argument to handle the login process. This feature is beneficial for accessing web pages that are secured behind password-protected directories. More details about the `ChromeHttpLoginCredentials` can be found in the API Documentation.

This technique provides a highly efficient way to convert URL-based content to PDF in Java environments.
