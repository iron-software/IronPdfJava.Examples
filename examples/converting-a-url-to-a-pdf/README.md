IronPDF simplifies the conversion of HTML content from various sources, including URLs, into PDF documents. This example demonstrates how to generate a PDF from web pages located on both local and external servers using the `PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf` method in Java. This function returns a `PdfDocument` object that you can subsequently export using the `saveAs` method.

The `PdfDocument.renderUrlAsPdf` method requires a String parameter that includes an absolute URL pointing to a web page. IronPDF efficiently fetches the HTML content from the URL through an HTTP request and converts it into a PDF. Additionally, developers have the option to pass login credentials (username and password) using a `ChromeHttpLoginCredentials` object. This feature is beneficial for accessing web pages within a password-protected directory. For further details on this, visit the [ChromeHttpLoginCredentials Class in API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/java/object-reference/api/).

This functionality provides an exceptional method to download PDFs from URLs in Java.
