To incorporate "sticky note"-style annotations into specific pages of a PDF document, utilize the `AnnotationManager` and the `AnnotationOptions` class from IronPDF. This allows you to pinpoint the exact location on the page where you wish the annotation to appear by specifying the text and Cartesian (x, y) coordinates in the `AnnotationOption` constructor, as depicted in the previous code snippet. Then, the `addTextAnnotation` method of the `AnnotationManager` can be used to insert the annotation into the working PDF document.

The `AnnotationOptions` class provides various methods enabling developers to personalize aspects such as the annotation's opacity, icon, and whether it is editable or printable. Additionally, options to adjust the color, height, width, title, subject, and content of the annotation are available, enhancing its functionality and integration.

### Steps to Add Annotations in PDFs Using Java

1. First, install the IronPDF Java library which supports adding annotations to PDFs.
2. Use the `PdfDocument` class to open an existing PDF file in your Java application.
3. Configure and style annotations with the `AnnotationOptions` class to meet your specific requirements.
4. Employ the `addTextAnnotation` function from IronPDF to append these annotations onto the chosen pages of the PDF.
5. Once all annotations are added, export the modified PDF document.
