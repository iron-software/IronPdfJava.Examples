***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/examples/annotations/>***

Use IronPDF's `PdfDocument` object and its `AnnotationManager`, along with the `AnnotationOptions` class, to embed "sticky note"-style annotations on certain pages of a PDF file.

To place a text-based annotation at a specific location on a page, indicate the text and the Cartesian (x, y) coordinates using the `AnnotationOption` constructor, as demonstrated in the code sample above. Then, apply the `addTextAnnotation` method from the `AnnotationManager` to incorporate the annotation into the desired page of the PDF document you are working with.

Each `AnnotationOptions` object provides additional methods that allow developers to fine-tune the visual and functional aspects of an annotation. The previous code example demonstrates how to adjust its opacity and icon, and set the annotation to be non-editable and non-printable. Moreover, developers have the flexibility to modify the annotation's color, dimensions, and title, as well as its title, subject, content, and placement.

## Steps to Create Annotations in a PDF Using Java

1. Install the IronPDF Java library to enable PDF annotations.
2. Employ the `PdfDocument` class to open an existing PDF document in Java.
3. Configure and personalize annotations using the `AnnotationOptions` class.
4. Deploy the `addTextAnnotation` method provided by IronPDF to append annotations to designated pages of the PDF.
5. Save the updated PDF file with the added annotations.
