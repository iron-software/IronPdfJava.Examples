To add "sticky note"-style annotations to a PDF, employ the `PdfDocument` object's `AnnotationManager` along with the `AnnotationOptions` class. This technique allows placement of text annotations at specified (x, y) coordinates on a PDF page.

Initiate by constructing a text annotation at a chosen location on a page. Pass the text and cartesian coordinates as arguments in the `AnnotationOptions` constructor. Then, utilize the `addTextAnnotation` method provided by the `AnnotationManager` to incorporate the annotation into your target page in the PDF document.

`AnnotationOptions` objects offer various methods that enable developers to tailor the visual and functional aspects of annotations. For instance, you can adjust its opacity, select an icon, and set properties to make the annotation non-editable and non-printable. Additional customization options include changing the color, dimensions, title, subject, and specific content or location of the annotation.

## Steps to Implement Annotations in PDFs Using Java

1. Install a Java library capable of manipulating PDF annotations.
2. Utilize the `PdfDocument` class to open an existing PDF.
3. Construct and personalize annotations using the `AnnotationOptions` class.
4. Apply `addTextAnnotation` to position annotations on desired PDF pages.
5. Save the modified PDF that now includes your annotations.
