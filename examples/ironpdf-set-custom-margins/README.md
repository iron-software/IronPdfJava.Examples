IronPDF generates PDF documents with a standard margin of 25 millimeters on all sides, which includes the top, bottom, left, and right. However, IronPDF also provides flexibility for developers to modify these margins individually to meet specific layout requirements.

Developers are able to customize margins for new PDFs by utilizing the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` class. The code example provided illustrates how to set custom margins, with left and right margins set to 20 millimeters and top and bottom margins set to 40 millimeters.

You can define margins to fit various document types such as letters, posters, postcards, and others, or even produce borderless documents ideal for commercial printing by assigning a zero millimeter value to each margin. Utilize the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` object in conjunction with PDF rendering methods like `renderUrlAsPdf`, `renderHtmlAsPdf`, and `renderHtmlFileAsPdf` to specify not only the margin sizes but also other print-related settings including paper size, DPI, and headers and footers. For additional details on the customization options available, refer to the [ChromePdfRenderOptions API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/docs/api/ironpdf.chromepdfrenderoptions/).
