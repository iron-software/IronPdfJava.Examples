IronPDF automatically generates new PDF documents with default margins of 25 millimeters on each side. Nonetheless, it offers flexibility for developers to customize margins according to specific layout requirements.

To customize margins for PDFs, developers utilize the `ChromePdfRenderOptions`. The illustrative example below demonstrates how to adjust the margins to 20 millimeters for the left and right sides, and 40 millimeters for the top and bottom sides.

It's possible to tailor PDF margins for various document types, including letters, posters, and postcards, or even produce borderless documents ideal for commercial printing by setting all margins to zero. The `ChromePdfRenderOptions` object can be integrated with PDF rendering methods, such as `renderUrlAsPdf`, `renderHtmlAsPdf`, and `renderHtmlFileAsPdf`. This combination allows developers to specify other print-related settings beyond just margin sizesâ€”like paper type, DPI, and the inclusion of headers and footers.
