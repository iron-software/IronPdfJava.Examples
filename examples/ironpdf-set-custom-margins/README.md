IronPDF automatically sets PDF documents with a default margin of 25 millimeters on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right). Nevertheless, IronPDF also provides the flexibility for developers to customize these margins according to specific design requirements.

Developers can tailor margins for new PDF documents by leveraging the `ChromePdfRenderOptions`. In the provided code example, customized margin settings include 20 millimeters for left and right and 40 millimeters for top and bottom margins.

IronPDF supports the customization of PDF margins for various document formats including letters, posters, postcards, and more. It even permits the creation of borderless documents ideal for commercial printing by setting all margins to zero millimeters. By using the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` objects along with PDF rendering methods (`renderUrlAsPdf`, `renderHtmlAsPdf`, and `renderHtmlFileAsPdf`), developers can define not only the margin sizes but also other print-specific options such as paper size, DPI, and headers and footers. For further details on the customization options available, refer to the [ChromePdfRenderOptions API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/docs/api/ironpdf.chromepdfrenderoptions/).
