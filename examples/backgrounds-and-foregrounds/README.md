IronPDF offers robust methods like `addBackground` and `addForeground` for incorporating elements from one PDF into another as either a background or a foreground. These functionalities are especially useful when creating series of PDFs that need a consistent design across documents.

Here's an overview of how you can implement these methods:

```java
addBackground(PdfDocument backgroundPdf);
addForeground(PdfDocument foregroundPdf);
```

These functions require `PdfDocument` objects, which can either be sourced from existing files via the `fromFile` method or freshly created using available PDF rendering techniques.

By default, `addBackground` and `addForeground` apply the first page of a multi-page PDF as the background or foreground. If you wish to select a different page, simply provide the page index as the second argument:

```java
// Set the third page as the background for all pages in the current PDF
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, 2);  

// Set the second page as the foreground for all pages in the current PDF
pdf.addForeground(foregroundPdf, 1);
```

To target specific pages for your background or foreground enhancement, use a `PageSelection` object. The following examples illustrate how to apply backgrounds to single pages or a range of pages within your PDF:

```java
// Apply the background to the fifth page only
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, PageSelection.singlePage(6));  

// Apply a background from the seventh to the sixteenth page
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, PageSelection.pageRange(6, 15));  

// Apply the background to just the very first page
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, PageSelection.firstPage());
```

If you're aiming to watermark PDF documents, consider using the `addWatermark` method. This offers greater flexibility in managing background positioning and transparency.
