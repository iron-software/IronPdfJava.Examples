IronPDF enables the incorporation of specific elements into PDF documents through the use of the methods `addBackground` and `addForeground`. These functions allow developers to use the contents of one PDF as the background or the foreground of another, making them highly effective for creating series of documents that follow a uniform template.

```java
addBackground(PdfDocument backgroundDoc);
addForeground(PdfDocument foregroundDoc);
```

The above methods interact with `PdfDocument` objects. Developers can obtain these objects either by converting existing files using the `fromFile` method or by creating them fresh with any of the provided PDF rendering tools.

By default, the `addBackground` and `addForeground` methods apply the first page of a multi-page PDF document as the respective background or foreground. To utilize different pages, simply specify the page index as the second argument in the method call.

```java
// Applying the third page of the background PDF across all pages of the current PDF
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, 2);

// Setting the second page of the foreground PDF for all pages of the current PDF
pdf.addForeground(foregroundPdf, 1);
```

To apply a PDF as a background or foreground on particular pages of an active PDF document, you can specify the target pages using a `PageSelection` object. The following code illustrates the application of backgrounds to specific single and multiple page ranges within a document.

```java
// Set the background for the fifth page of the active PDF
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, PageSelection.singlePage(6));

// Apply a different background ranging from pages 7 to 16 of the active PDF
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, PageSelection.pageRange(6, 15));

// Affix a unique background to the first page only
pdf.addBackground(backgroundPdf, PageSelection.firstPage());
```

Another useful tool for customizing PDF documents is the `addWatermark` method. This feature serves as a straightforward alternative to `addBackground`, offering additional control over the positioning and transparency of the background elements.
