Java developers now have the capability to integrate electronic and digital signatures into PDF files programmatically through the `Signature` and `SignatureManager` classes provided by IronPDF for Java.

To implement a digital signature, begin by creating a new instance of the `Signature` class, specifying the paths of a valid `.pfx` or `.p12` certificate and its corresponding password. Afterward, utilize the `signPdfWithSignature` method from the `SignatureManager` associated with the PDF to authenticate the document with the designated certificate.

IronPDF enhances this functionality by facilitating the inclusion of signature images, whether they are computer-generated text images or digital scans of actual handwriting. These images can be added to a signature by employing the `addSignatureImage` method before executing the signing process on the PDF.

If there's a necessity to incorporate a handwritten-style signature directly onto a PDF page, the [`HtmlStamper`](https://ironpdf.com/java/object-reference/api/com/ironsoftware/ironpdf/stamp/HtmlStamper.html) class can be used. This class allows for the addition of HTML-formatted text and images across one or several document pages.

# How to Add a Digital Signature to a PDF Programmatically in Java

1. Install the Java library that enables digital signatures on PDFs.
2. Leverage intuitive APIs to either load an existing PDF or generate a new one.
3. Instantiate a `Signature` object and specify detailed signature attributes.
4. Obtain a `SignatureManager` by invoking the `getSignature` method on a PDF document instance.
5. Execute the `signPdfWithSignature` method available in the `SignatureManager` to apply the digital signature to the PDF.
