The showcased code snippet highlights the document printing functionality of IronPDF.

Utilizing the `print` method allows developers to incorporate the printing of operational PDF documents directly into their application's workflow. When executed as shown, the `print` method triggers the operating system's print dialog, permitting the user to select various print options such as the printer model, paper dimensions, and the quantity of copies.

For immediate printing with standard settings, opt for the `printWithoutDialog` method instead of the regular `print` method.
