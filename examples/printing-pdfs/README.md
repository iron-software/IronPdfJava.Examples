The code snippet highlighted showcases the document printing feature provided by IronPDF.

Utilizing the `print` method, developers have the ability to integrate PDF document printing within their application workflows. By employing the `print` method as illustrated, the system's print dialog is triggered, allowing users to configure various print settings such as the printer selection, paper size, and copy quantity. An optional parameter allows for paper customization.

For immediate printing of a PDF with the system's preset settings, opt for the `printWithoutDialog` method instead of the standard `print` method.
