The code snippet showcased below highlights the document printing functionalities of IronPDF.

Using the `print` method, developers have the ability to integrate PDF document printing directly into their application workflows. When you apply the `print` method as shown, it triggers the default print dialog of the operating system. This allows end-users to adjust various print settings such as the printer selection, paper size, and the number of copies to print.

For those scenarios where you would like to immediately print the PDF with the system's default printer settings, the `printWithoutDialog` method is the alternative to consider instead of the standard `print` method.
