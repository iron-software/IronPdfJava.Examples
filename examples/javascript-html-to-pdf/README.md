IronPDF empowers users to seamlessly integrate images into PDFs by embedding them directly into HTML strings, rather than relying on them as external assets. This capability is applicable to:

- Image files
- `System.Drawing.Image`
- `System.Drawing.Bitmap`

Incorporating images this way can enhance the speed of the _HTML to PDF_ conversion process and facilitates storing rendering jobs in alternative storage options like strings or databases instead of traditional file-systems.
