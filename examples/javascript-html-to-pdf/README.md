IronPDF supports the direct embedding of images into PDF documents, enabling users to integrate images right into HTML strings instead of managing them as external assets:

- Image Files
- `System.Drawing.Image`
- `System.Drawing.Bitmap`

This capability is particularly beneficial for bypassing the need to load external assets during the _HTML to PDF_ conversion process. It enhances performance and facilitates storing entire rendering processes in non-traditional storage mediums like strings or databases.
