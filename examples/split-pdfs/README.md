This example illustrates how Java developers can utilize IronPDF's PDF editing capabilities to accomplish a popular task: dividing a PDF into smaller segments.

Developers can swiftly create a new PDF document that includes a specific range of pages from the original document by using the `copyPages` method.

In the provided example, this technique is applied to generate two new PDF documents; the first encompasses the initial page, while the second contains the second and third pages of a newly created PDF. This method ensures the preservation of the content and structure of the original document, while the selected content is duplicated into separate filesâ€”effectively dividing the PDF for practical purposes. This strategy is particularly beneficial when developers need to maintain the original document intact for backup reasons.

An alternative method for segmenting a PDF (which doesn't preserve the original file) can be achieved by employing the `copyPages` method in tandem with the `removePages` method.

# How to Divide PDF Files in Java

1. Install the Java library required for PDF division.
2. Open an existing PDF or render a new one in Java.
3. Use the `copyPage` method to duplicate the desired PDF pages into another `PdfDocument` instance.
4. Save the new `PdfDocument` using the `saveAs` function.
5. Execute step 3 with just a single line of Java code.
