This code snippet illustrates how Java developers can utilize IronPDF's PDF editing capabilities to perform a common task: dividing a PDF into several smaller ones.

By employing the `copyPages` method, developers can efficiently create a new PDF document that includes a specified set of pages from an original document.

The example showcased here uses this method to create two new PDF documents; the first containing the initial page, and the second holding the second and third pages, from a newly-generated PDF. This method ensures the original content and structure remains intact, while selectively replicating parts of it into new filesâ€”essentially "splitting" the document. This technique is particularly useful where there is a need to preserve the original document for archival purposes.

Another variation of splitting a PDF (which involves altering the original file) involves using the `copyPages` method together with the `removePages` method.

# Steps to Split PDF Files in Java

1. Install the IronPDF Java library to enable PDF document splitting.
2. Load an existing PDF or generate a new PDF in Java.
3. Use the `copyPages` method to duplicate selected pages into a new `PdfDocument` object.
4. Save the new `PdfDocument` using the `saveAs` method.
5. Execute step 3 with just a single line of Java code.
