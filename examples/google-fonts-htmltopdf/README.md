IronPDF achieves immaculate reproduction of PDF files from HTML, accurately portraying custom web fonts, including those from libraries like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/).

The library also caters to custom WOFF and SVG CSS font packages from sources like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

For a successful conversion of a webpage that uses these special fonts to PDF, developers must introduce a delay in IronPDFâ€™s HTML-to-PDF conversion process. This is achieved by adjusting the `renderDelay` attribute of a `ChromePdfRenderOptions` object to an appropriate value, ideally using the `setRenderDelay` method. Generally, a delay of at least 500 milliseconds (half a second) is adequate to ensure complete loading of all custom fonts and icons before the conversion.

It's important to note, though, that custom web fonts might not function in Windows Apps running on Azure because of certain security constraints.
