IronPDF offers meticulous PDF creation from HTML sources, ensuring precise renderings of elaborate web fonts, including those from resources like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Bootstrap Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/).

It fully supports custom WOFF and SVG font packs often sourced from popular online type foundries such as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

For converting HTML pages that include various custom fonts into a complete PDF document, it is critical for developers to implement a proper PDF rendering delay via IronPDF's conversion engine. This involves setting the `renderDelay` attribute of the `ChromePdfRenderOptions` object to an appropriate duration using its `setRenderDelay` method. Typically, a pause of at least 500 milliseconds, or half a second, will generally be adequate to allow all fonts and icons to fully load before the conversion process begins.

It's important to be aware that web fonts are not supported in Windows Apps that operate on Azure, due to security constraints.
