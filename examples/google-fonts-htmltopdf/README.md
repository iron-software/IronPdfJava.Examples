IronPDF delivers flawless PDF conversion from HTML, capturing every detail of custom web fonts, including those offered by libraries like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Bootstrap Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/).

The tool also embraces support for WOFF and SVG CSS font packages from online type foundries such as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

When converting web pages that incorporate custom fonts to PDF, it's essential for developers to apply a rendering delay in IronPDF's HTML-to-PDF conversion engine. This can be accomplished by setting the `renderDelay` parameter of a `ChromePdfRenderOptions` instance. Assign a minimum delay of 500 milliseconds (half a second) using the `setRenderDelay` method to ensure all font and icon assets are completely loaded before the conversion process begins.

It is important to mention that due to security restrictions, web fonts may not function in Windows Apps hosted on Azure.
