Developers are enabled to incorporate bookmarks into PDF documents by using the `BookmarkManager`. This is accessed through the `getBookmarks` method of the `PdfDocument` object.

```java
BookmarkManager bookmarks = pdf.getBookmarks();
```

In the provided code example, four top-tier bookmarks are sequentially added to an active `PdfDocument` using the `addBookmarkAtEnd` method, and then the changes are saved to the storage device. When the updated PDF is opened, the bookmarks are displayed in the following sequence:

- Author's Note
- Table of Content
- Summary
- References

Additionally, the `addBookmarkAtStart` method is available to insert a bookmark at the beginning, causing it to appear before any existing bookmarks. For instance, executing the following code after Line 16 in the previous example would position the "Foreword" bookmark at the start of the bookmark list.

```java
bookmarks.addBookMarkAtStart("Foreword", 1);
```

IronPDF robustly supports the integration of bookmarks created with other third-party tools, significantly enhancing its adaptability for managing and adjusting bookmarks in PDFs that have already been created, according to specific organizational needs.
